# LandscapeBuilder
An automation tool for building Condor V2 landscapes

Distributed with "How in the world?" texture set by Jenna Fearon.

The LandscapeBuilderLib project is where the meat of the program is. It targets .NET Standard, and is used by LandscapeBuilder (a .NET Core CLI) and by LandscapeBuilderGUI (a .NET Framework GUI) to build the landscapes.
